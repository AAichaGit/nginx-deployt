This are just samples of two manifest files used to create a deployment and service from my DevOp training: case of nginx.
the manifest files (for creating a svc & deplyt) work just as it is.
I included some notes inside for your better understanding.
NB= to create a svc:{kubectl apply -f nginx-service.ymal} 
And to create a deployt:{kubectl apply -f nginx-deployment.ymal} from your CLI using these two configuration files.
