This is just a sample from my DevOp training.
the manifest files (for creating a svc & deplyt) work just as it is and I included some notes inside for your better understanding.
NB= to create a svc: {kubectl apply -f nginx-service.ymal} and deployt: {kubectl apply -f nginx-deployment.ymal} from your CLI using these two configuration files.
